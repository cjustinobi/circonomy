        <p>
          The way we take, make, and remake things is deeply problematic.
          From our constant extraction of materials to our greenwashing.
          From our supply chains to our value chains - we have an economy that
          cares only to minimize costs and maximize profits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solutions like the “3 R’s” look, sound, and appear to be fine but in fact -
          the majority of our products gets either dumped into a landfill, thrown into a
          Developing Country, and/or incinerated thereby negatively contributing more to climate change.
